# Advent of Code - 2023

My solutions to the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/).

Note: this project uses Bun unstead of Node, so you may need to install it in order to run this code.

---

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run for day 1

```bash
bun run index.ts -d 1
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.0.6. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
